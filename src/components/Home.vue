        <h3>What is social distancing?</h3>
        <p>
          Social distancing measures are steps you can take to reduce social interaction between people. This will help reduce the transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19).
          They are to:
        </p>
        <p>Avoid contact with someone who is displaying symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19). These symptoms include high temperature and/or new and continuous cough</p>
        <p>Avoid non-essential use of public transport when possible</p>
        <p>Work from home, where possible. Your employer should support you to do this. Please refer to employer guidance for more information</p>
        <p>Avoid large and small gatherings in public spaces, noting that pubs, restaurants,</p>
        <p>leisure centres and similar venues are currently shut as infections spread easily in closed spaces where people gather together.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Handwashing and respiratory hygiene</h3>
        <p>There are general principles you can follow to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including:</p>
        <p>washing your hands more often - with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use a hand sanitiser when you get home or into work, when you blow your nose, sneeze or cough, eat or handle food</p>
        <p>avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands</p>
        <p>avoid close contact with people who have symptoms</p>
        <p>cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in a bin and wash your hands</p>
        <p>clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces in the home</p>
